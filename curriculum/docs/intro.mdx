# Tutorial Intro

Some issues with using docusaurus since it uses mdx v1, not v2
1. A paragraph starting with a JSX tag will be seen entirely as a JSX string:  
  <span style={{color: 'red'}}>Highlighted text</span> but afterwards _Markdown_ **doesn't work**  
2. Markdown within a JSX tag never works:  
  <span style={{color: 'red'}}>**Bold doesn't work**</span>
  must move it outside the tags
3. This will be a code block

<div style={{color: 'red'}}>

    You may think I'm just some text...

</div>
